en_abstract = "This paper describes a procedure to design potential functions for path following control of port-Hamiltonian systems. The conventional path following control method needs to find a time invariant potential function which takes its minimum on the desired path. It is difficult to find such a function for a complex path, since it has to satisfy additional several constraints. Inspired by the results of the existing trajectory tracking control method of port-Hamiltonian systems, we propose an improved path following control method in which a potential function for path following control is acquired by solving simple partial differential equations."

By constructing the variational system of the original state space model with respect to a model parameter, we evaluate the sensitivity of the system behavior with respect to parameter variation. Some properties of the variational system, such as stability and controllability, are examined. A sufficient condition to realize robust LQ optimal control is obtained by investigating the controllability of the variational system. A numerical example exhibits how the proposed control method works with controllability analysis."
